# Titanic---Machine_Learning_from_Disaster

Using Machine Learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

This is a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (i.e., name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## What Data Will I Use

There are two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.

`Train.csv` contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.

`Test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger.

## Goal

The goal is to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.

The following `shubham-1.ipynb` file is a notebook from kaggle where you can see the code only in preview section, the code section has only a link which was used to connect the kaggle notebook to GitHub.

I have explained the code in the comments in the preview section. Hope you like it.
